# Google_Painting
An exercise before Google hash code 2016 event. 

Introduction
The day has come to paint a huge mural on the facade of the Google Parisâ€‹ office.
A picture has been decided on and a specialized machine has been hired to perform the painting.
Unfortunately, it turns out that the painting operations supported by the machine are quite low-level.
Therefore before putting the machine to work, the target picture has to be translated into a list of
instructions supported by the machine.

For further details on the problem statement, please take a look on PDF file present in this repository.
